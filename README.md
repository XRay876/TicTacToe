Title: Tic-Tac-Toe Game: Human vs Computer

Description: This application is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game where a human player competes against the computer on a 3x3 grid. The player can choose their sign ('X' or 'O') and decide who makes the first move. The game demonstrates the fundamental concepts of JavaScript, including variables, data types, control flow, loops, arrays, functions, and modules. It showcases practical use of these concepts by implementing game logic, user interaction, and modular code organization. The application includes an interactive HTML page where users can play Tic-Tac-Toe directly in their web browser, providing a user-friendly interface and real-time gameplay experience.

PS: main.py only shows the structure of the project and game works on console. JS and html files for starting the game in the browser. To start the local server u can use python (python -m http.server 8000)
